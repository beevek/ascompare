About
----------------------------------------------------------------------
ascompare compares the connectivity of networks.  It uses publicly
available academic datasets to construct an AS graph and then applies
some simple graph algorithms to compute what percentage of ASes on the
Internet and what percentage of public /24s are reachable within x
AS-hops of a given set of networks.  In ascompare, a "network" is a
set of ASes that are logically grouped together, e.g., all ASes
belonging to a company.  Running ascompare with several networks
performs the same computations on each and generates a report that
compares them all.

Compiling
----------------------------------------------------------------------
ascompare requires Boost (www.boost.org).  just run "make" to compile.

Running
----------------------------------------------------------------------
ascompare requires two input files:
* an edge file that contains links between ASes
* an AS description file with some details about each AS

each line of the edge file has the format:
  FROM-ASN TO-ASN HOPS
where FROM-ASN and TO-ASN are ASNs and HOPS is the number of hops
between the two ASes.  usually HOPS is 1, but occasionally some
datasets find routes between two ASes that are longer because the ASes
of intermediate routers cannot be determined (c.f. CAIDA aslinks).

each line of the AS description file has the format:
  ASN NAME CONE24 CONEPREF CONEAS
where NAME is a description with _no_ spaces, CONE24 is the number of
/24s in the AS's customer cone, CONEPREF is the number of prefixes in
the customer cone, and CONEAS is the number of ASes in the customer
cone.  generally you should use CAIDA's as-info data.

Get datasets from the sources below, then convert them into the proper
format:
* CAIDA as-info: asinfo2aslist.pl [input] > as.dat
* CAIDA aslinks: aslinks2edge.pl [input] > edges.dat
* UCLA links: links2edge.pl [input] > edges.dat
* CAIDA as-rel:  links2edge.pl [input] > edges.dat

Run ascompare like:
  ascompare edges.dat as.dat LABEL:asn1,asn2,... LABEL:asn1,asn2,...

Each LABEL:asn1,asn2,... group specifies a single "network", since
often a company or other entity owns multiple ASes.  For example,
Level3 would be:
  Level3:3356,11213,594,21233
(at least, according to the CAIDA data as of July 2008).

If you want to generate an HTML report with some graphs, pipe the
output of ascompare to makereport.pl.  Pass one argument to
makereport.pl, a prefix for all output files.  For example:
  ascompare caida-edges.dat as.dat ... | makereport.pl output/caida
will result in a report at output/caida.html.  (All related images
will be called output/caida-[imgname].png.)
